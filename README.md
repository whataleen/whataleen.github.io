INTRODUCTION
------------

This is a refactoring of Horiseon website for accessibility. This website will display a first page which will include three navâ€™s on the top right that can be clicked on that moved to a new page with information. The website will have a body with paragraphs and the left three floaters.   



REQUIREMENTS
------------

This module requires the following modules:

This website will maintain all of its functionality, but will develop improvements to make this website accessible.  


RECOMMENDED MODULES
-------------------

 * The Horiseon will provide nav functionality and accessibility features by adding alt tags next to the images for the blind. Comments will also be added throughout the files so that it is clear to what the code purposes will be used and shown on the URL when linked.



INSTALLATION
------------
 
 * Install
 The process of this installation was to first create a unique name for the website.
Then to clone all the given files on my git lab which then was added to separate files into one folder in the appropriate sequel. 
I then added alt tags and comments to make it accessible and more organized.
After saving the file I had to make sure the URL worked.



CONFIGURATION
-------------
 
  I have made this file accessible while leaving the structure and functionality of the website the same. 



TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

  I crossed a problem trying to get the URL to work at first. After an hour or so I saw I was in the wrong branch which was the main reason why to URL was not showing at all. However after making the change I was able to get the website up and running.
